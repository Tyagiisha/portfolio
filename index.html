              Driven by their love of technology and creative problem-solving skills, web developers
               use a variety of natural and acquired web development skills in their work. They can

            <p>Strong verbal and written communication skills are desired traits that show up on innumerable job descriptions, 
              and for good reason. As a web developer, I may be called upon to explain a programming or functionality problem,

               no technical background at all. I might communicate with them by email, phone or in person.
                The ability to make complex subjects understandable to others, enabling them to make decisions,

            <p>Web development involves creating and maintaining a website that is user-friendly,

               the foundation of any successful digital marketing campaign. It’s the first impression that potential customers
                have of your business, so it’s essential to make sure it’s a good one</p>
